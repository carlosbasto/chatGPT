# Integrating ChatGPT with SAP HANA Cloud for Data Analytics
This repository contains experimental code for utilizing ChatGPT in conjunction with SAP HANA Cloud for data analytics. The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the potential of using ChatGPT for generating insightful queries on SAP HANA Cloud, and to show how natural language processing capabilities can make data analytics more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Getting Started
The repository contains scripts for creating Chatbot instances with the ability to run queries on SAP HANA Cloud using ChatGPT. These scripts are a demonstration of the potential future integrations between ChatGPT and the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) specifically SAP HANA Cloud.

Please note that at the moment of this writing, there is no official API for ChatGPT. So, some non-official packages are used in these examples and there may be some limitations such as the model's ability to remember only 3000 words or 4000 tokens from the current conversation.
